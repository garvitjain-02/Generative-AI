Cricket echoes through the sunlit ground,  
With leather ball and willow sound.  
Batsmen dance with careful grace,  
Chasing runs at thrilling pace.  

Fielders leap with hawk-like eyes,  
Underneath the open skies.  
The stumps await with bated breath,  
Each ball a brush with fate or death.  

From village green to stadium loud,  
Cricket unites a cheering crowd.
